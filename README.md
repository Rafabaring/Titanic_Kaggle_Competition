# Titanic_Kaggle_Competition

This is my first (ever) application of any machine learning model. In this repository, you will find a simple application of Logistic Regression from sklearn and data manipulation in order to apply the model

In my first steps toward shifting my carreer to Data Science, I took an on-line course at Udemy that introduced me to sklearn.

In order to put my learnings up to the test, I choose the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster Kaggle challenge to participate in.

WHAT TO RUN

You can find and download my work under Titanic_Logistic_Regression.ipynb. As there are a lot of charts and data visualization in this file, I highly recommend to run it with a Jupyter notebook installed in your computer (http://jupyter.org/)

WHAT YOU WILL FIND

My purpose in this study is not to derive to the logistic model. But to apply the recently learned sklearn logistic reg model. Also, manipulate data to fit the model in and do a few analyzes to better understand the dataset

WHAT I EXPECT

Please, feel free to download, evaluate, analyze, comment and give me feedback on my work. As this is my very first application of machine learning, any feedback is highly appreciated. I truly believe that people grow with constructive feedback. I'm very excited to hear what you have to say about my work.

Have fun
